          I’m Victor Melia, a Video Game Developer focused on real-time graphics, VFX, and computer graphics research.
          I enjoy building gameplay systems, stylized rendering techniques, and experimental prototypes that push how games
          look and feel.

          <p>
            My work sits at the intersection of <strong>gameplay</strong> and <strong>visual technology</strong>.
            I’ve been developing games and prototypes using Unity, exploring topics like non-photorealistic rendering,
            GPU foliage instancing and real-time VFX for immersive player experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond shipped projects and game jams, I’m heavily involved in <strong>R&amp;D</strong>:
            presenting papers, experimenting with shaders, and testing how visual style impacts player perception.
            I like solving problems that require both technical precision and strong artistic direction.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I’m not tweaking shaders or particle systems, I’m usually prototyping gameplay ideas,
            reading graphics papers, or collaborating with small teams to bring experimental concepts to life.
